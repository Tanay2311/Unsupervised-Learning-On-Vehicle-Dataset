Unsupervised Learning Project: Vehicle Dataset Analysis

Overview

This project aims to analyze a vehicle dataset using unsupervised learning techniques. The dataset contains various attributes of vehicles, and the goal is to discover meaningful patterns and insights without relying on labeled data.

Dataset

The vehicle dataset used in this project contains information about different vehicles, including features such as make, model, engine size, fuel efficiency, and horsepower. The dataset is provided in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) format.

Goals

Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Apply unsupervised learning algorithms to identify clusters and patterns within the dataset.
Evaluate the performance of different clustering techniques and determine the optimal number of clusters.
Interpret the results and derive insights about vehicle characteristics and market segmentation.
Tools and Libraries

Python programming language
Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis
pandas for data manipulation
scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
